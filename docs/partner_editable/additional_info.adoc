* If a DNS domain option was specified, login to EKS Bastion host and execute: _curl -k \https://rancher.[domain specified]/_
* If a DNS domain option was *NOT* specified, login to EKS Bastion host and execute: _curl -k \https://rancher.aws.private/_

The output should look something like this:

== Post deployment steps
Rancher verification and initial configuration::
1. Deploy a RDP Bastion host into a public subnet of the VPC which hosts the EKS worker nodes
2. Open a browser and enter the Rancher console URL as shown above
3. Complete the initial configurations such as creating an admin password

Uninstallation of Rancher::
1. An uninstall script is included in the https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-eks-rancher/blob/main/functions/source/rancher_uninstall.sh[git repository.] It takes two parameters [AWS Region] [domain name].  Download it onto the EKS bastion host if you wish to uninstall rancher.
2. From the bastion host, as ec2-user, run this command ``kubectl edit namespace cattle-system`` and remove the finalizer called ``controller.cattle.io/namespace-auth``. Second, execute the uninstall script (i.e. ``sh rancher_uninstall.sh us-east-2 my.domain``)
