* If a DNS domain option was specified, log in to the Amazon EKS bastion host, and run: _curl -k \https://rancher.[domain specified]/_
* If a DNS domain option was not specified, log in to the Amazon EKS bastion host, and run: _curl -k \https://rancher.aws.private/_

The output should look like the following:

== Post-deployment steps
Rancher verification and initial configuration::
1. Deploy an RDP bastion host into a public subnet of the VPC that hosts the EKS worker nodes.
2. Open a browser, and navigate to the Rancher console URL.
3. Complete the initial configurations, such as creating an administrator password.

Uninstalling Rancher::
1. An uninstall script is included in the https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-eks-rancher/blob/main/functions/source/rancher_uninstall.sh[git repository^]. It requires parameters for [AWS Region] and [domain name]. If you want to uninstall rancher, download the script to the Amazon EKS bastion host.
2. From the bastion host, as ec2-user, run ``kubectl edit namespace cattle-system``, and remove the finalizer called ``controller.cattle.io/namespace-auth``. 3. Run the uninstall script (that is, ``sh rancher_uninstall.sh us-east-2 my.domain``).
